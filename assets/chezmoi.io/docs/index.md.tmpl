# chezmoi

Manage your dotfiles across multiple diverse machines, securely.

The latest version of chezmoi is {{ $version }} ([release notes]({{
$latestRelease.HTMLURL }}), [release history](/reference/release-history)).

chezmoi helps you manage your personal configuration files (dotfiles, like
`~/.gitconfig`) across multiple machines.

chezmoi provides many features beyond symlinking or using a bare git repo
including: templates (to handle small differences between machines), password
manager support (to store your secrets securely), importing files from archives
(great for shell and editor plugins), full file encryption (using gpg or age),
and running scripts (to handle everything else).

With chezmoi, pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-moi), you can install chezmoi and your
dotfiles from your GitHub dotfiles repo on a new, empty machine with a single
command:

```console
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

As well as the `curl | sh` installation, you can [install chezmoi with your
favorite package manager](/install/).

Updating your dotfiles on any machine is a single command:

```console
$ chezmoi update
```
